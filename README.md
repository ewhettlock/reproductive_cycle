Code used for paper "Dynamic changes in uterine NK cell subset frequency and function over the menstrual cycle and pregnancy"


Four datasets were used in this intergration. There are four files explaining how each dataset was analysed and subset to just immune cells. There is one script covering the intergration of these four immune datasets, one covering the analyse of the intergrated data and then a couple describing how the graphs in the paper were made from the dataset.
